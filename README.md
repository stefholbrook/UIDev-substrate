Photo App
===============

Clone this repo and create a responsive image gallery in React with the ability to move to the next/previous photos and display the photo title. You can use the [Pok√©api](https://pokeapi.co/) or any API of your choosing for data. Include and/or create what ever other resources you may need then submit a pull request. 

Make sure to document your decision process in your code and elaborate on challenges and solutions in your commit messages and pull requests.

Keep in mind, this is more about problem solving rather than strictly skill with code. Highlight areas you are strong in, but don't sweat any weaker areas too much.
